<h1>Horizontal Scroll Widget</h1>
<p>In most cases, our job as responsive web developers is to make sure our content doesn't overflow its container (let alone the viewport).</p>
<p>But what if we're making an online shop and want to build a widget that suggests similar products? We might decide that we want to let our users scroll through a catalogue, but don't want it to take up as much room as everything in a search results or product category page. This is where horizontal scroll widgets come in.</p>


<h2>Shop Semi-Permanent Dyes</h2>
<p>Our Vegan Semi-Permanent Colour is a great way to try out new shades and be a little bit more adventurous with the way you look. Whether that's dyeing your hair a new shade or giving it some shine, this product will be able to help you achieve a head-turning style in no time at all.</p>
