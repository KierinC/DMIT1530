<h2>Honey</h2>

<p>Dog, Large Breed</p>

<p>Why, hello there! My name is Honey because I’m the sweetest girl you’ll ever meet. I love all the humans I come across and will wiggle on up to you for pets. </p>

<p>I like long walks in the river valley, laying in fresh snow, and will do anything for roast chicken or cheese. I love small children and wouldn't mind giving them a cuddle (so long as they don't pull my tail!).</p>

<p>I can’t wait to meet you and play! </p>

<p>As you can see, I like to spend as much time as possible in the great outdoors. This is because I was bred to be a livestock guardian and am used to being out with the chickens and sheep, rain or shine.</p>

    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>PawPals is a service that lets you book time with cuddly animals in your area so that you can manage to squeeze one (1) single crumb of serotonin from your sleep-deprived brain. No, this isn't a real website, but don't you seriously wish it could be?</p>
