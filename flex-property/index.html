			<div class="flex-row">
				<p>As you know, I'm quite keen on comic books. Especially the ones about superheroes. I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating.</p>

				<p>Take my favorite superhero, Superman. Not a great comic book, not particularly well-drawn, but the mythology? The mythology is not only great, it's unique.</p>

				<p>Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is, there's the superhero and there's the alter ego. Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-row">
				<p>When that character wakes up in the morning, he's Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man. And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone. Superman didn't become Superman. Superman was born Superman.</p>

				<p>When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red "S," that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-row">
				<p>What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.</p>
